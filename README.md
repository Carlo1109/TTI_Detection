#  Tool–Tissue Interaction (TTI) Detection, Isolation, and Identification in Minimally Invasive Surgery

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a system for **automatic detection, isolation, and identification of tool–tissue interactions** during **laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)** procedures.  
The goal is to enhance computer-assisted surgical systems by accurately analyzing how surgical tools interact with tissue, supporting **surgical workflow recognition**, **skill assessment**, and **context-aware assistance**.

##  Objectives

- **Detection** – Identify when a surgical tool interacts with tissue in endoscopic video frames.  
- **Isolation** – Segment and localize the specific region of interaction.  
- **Identification** – Classify the type of interaction (e.g., grasping, dissecting, retracting).  

These steps form a multi-stage pipeline contributing to the next generation of **minimally invasive surgery (MIS)** support systems.
